## Description

Sticky and mobile navigation, smooth scrolling and image optimization are used in this responsive website. Everything is custom made. Since this is one of the first projects I've done on my own, without any help or tutorials, it was quite difficult for me to do everything as I wanted and the project took a lot of time. The most important thing for me is that I went through it and learned.

#### Technologies
